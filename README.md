# 🚀 Clustr — Skill Bartering Network

**Clustr** is a skill-sharing platform that connects people who want to **learn new skills** with people who can **teach them** — using a **credit-based system instead of money**.

A community-powered learning marketplace where knowledge is the currency. 💡

---

## 🌟 Problem We Solve

Learning new skills can be expensive and inaccessible.
At the same time, millions of people have valuable skills they could teach.

**Clustr bridges this gap.**

Instead of paying money:

* Earn **credits by teaching**
* Spend **credits by learning**

A fair, community-driven ecosystem.
